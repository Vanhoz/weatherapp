# This model initially had no columns defined. If you add columns to the
# model remove the '{}' from the fixture names and add the columns immediately
# below each fixture, per the syntax in the comments below
#

  city_name: 'MyCity'
  city_id: 'MyId'
  user: one
# column: value
#
two:
  city_name: 'MyCity'
  city_id: 'MyId'
  user: two
# column: value
